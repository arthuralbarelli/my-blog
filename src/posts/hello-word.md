# Hello, World!

As is typical for most of software developers, we usually start a project with a "Hello, World"!

I'm doing the same with my blog.

Here i will write about my tech learning journey, including the tips, challenges and everything that I think that could help you in your journey too.

I hope you like.
See you soon.
