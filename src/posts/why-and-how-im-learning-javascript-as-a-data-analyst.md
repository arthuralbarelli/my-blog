One of main reasons to learn JavaScript is to diversify my skills.

As Data Analyst, I've been working with a lot of tools like Power Bi, Tableau, Python, Scala, Spark, etc. And even with so many tools, the number of new challenges that have been appearing today are not the same as at the beginning of my career.

Even though, I'm constantly learning new things about data analytics, the "learning friction" isn't the same and in some way I like this friction. It helps me to stay motivated and confident about my career.

My train of thought is: to be a more valuable and antifragile IT professional, i need to be capable of working on various issues in the programming world.

With this in mind I decided to add a new programming to my stack: JavaScript.

# Why JavaScript?

I choose JavaScript because it's a versatile language (it can be used on back and front-end) and constantly bleeding-edge technologies have been appearing with it.

And learning bleeding-edge technologies is a way to stay competitive in the learning race because, in some way, all early adopters will be at a similar level during the learning process. This was a concept that I learned with [Sibelius Seraphini](https://twitter.com/sseraphini).

# How I am learning it?

I am creating projects: this blog uses SvelteKit, I am developing an app using React Native.

When you create a project, many problems appear and you need to iterate fast to overcome them. The more problems you solve in your project, the more confidence you gain with the language and framework.

Some times it's painful, but it's the best way to cement the knowledge in your head.

With the goal of iterating quickly on problems, I'm using Chat GPT-4. Although it's very helpful, many of answers need adjustments, and that's a good thing because it forces me to think about the problem. Therefore, reading documentation and blogs is still necessary.
