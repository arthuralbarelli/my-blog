The best way to show that you are a good programmer or data analyst (or any other code-related job) is solving problems in real-time.

But the second way to show your skills is creating personal projects, coding and commiting it frequently.

This way you are automatically creating your portfolio and once you also are sharing these projects in a remote repository like GitHub/Gitlab, you are automatically contributing for a boost in your SEO, and also you are creating an opportunity to be known as reference in a specific Stack that you are using.

## How to commit frequently?
Many people struggle in commit your code for fear of not pushing "Good Code" (aka Impostor Syndrome).

My tip for you: is commit every little thing that represents ANY improvement or step ahead in your project.

I'm doing this: if you are reading this blog post in its release date, you can notice there is no design in this website. I'll improve it later.

Always think in your remote repository as your resume/portfolio. Start small, but improve it frequently.

Every commited code matters.

See you soon.
